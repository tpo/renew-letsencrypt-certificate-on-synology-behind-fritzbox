usage: renew-le-certificate
       renew-le-certificate --help

    Renew a Letsencrypt certificate on a Synology box,
    that is behind a FRITZ!Box.

    1. will open port 80 forwarding on a FRITZ!Box to
       the Synology box
    2. will renew the Letsencrypt certificate on the
       Synology box
    3. will disable the port 80 forwarding

    This script (and if needed its config files) need
    to be installed on and run from the Synology box
    and the Synology box needs to be able to reach the
    FRITZ!Box.

     You can set the following variables directly in the
     script, or in ~/.renew-le-certificate.conf :

         SYNOLOGY=0.0.0.1

     Also to see what Fritzbox settings you need to set
     execute:

         fritzbox-forward-port --help

     NOTE: this script depends on the fritzbox-forward-port
           script from https://github.com/tpo/fritzbox-forwad-port
